# Email-Verify

I've written a simple script to verify all email addresses in a csv file and fetch all emails data through the csv file reader. I'm trying to read mxrecords from the respective domains.
Upload a csv file and verify all your emails addresses that you've in the csv format. It'll send a request to respective domain and check for MX-reports. It respond code and message. Please make sure domains allows you to get requests.
You're IP can get blocked if domains not allowed to do such activities.
